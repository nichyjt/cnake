# CNAKE :snake:
## About
This is a personal mini-project where I recreate the classic Snake game using pure C and ncurses.  

Th core logic of the game uses a Linked List. I just wanted to experiment around with this data structure.

## Pre-requisites:
LINUX: The compiled ELF file will work out of the box with any terminal software.  
MACOS/WINDOWS: You will need to compile main.c using your architecture-specific C compiler. You also need to have the ncurses library installed.  

```bash
$ gcc main.c -lncurses -o cnake
```

## How to play:  
Run the 'cnake' file via terminal/command line.  
Press any button to play. Controls and exit instructions are displayed in the game. Have fun!
