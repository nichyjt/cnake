# CNAKE :snake:
## About
This is a personal mini-project where I recreate the classic Snake game using pure C and ncurses.  
I designed the core logic of the game to use a Linked List just to experiment around with this data structure.

// TODO: Add in the compiled binary file for linux

## Pre-requisites:
- Linux Computer  

If you wish to compile for Windows, you need to compile `main.c` using `mingw32` for the `gcc` compiler. The program has NOT been tested for Windows machines, but should work fine.  

## How to play:  
Run the 'cnake' file via terminal/command line.  
Press any button to play. Controls and exit instructions are displayed in the game.
